# ros_poke_arm

Just another set of packages home brewed, but this time the robotic arm contains a prismatic joint 
and all the packages are developed without external code except for the poke_description package. Just 
urdf is taken from that package also prismatic joint is added later. 

the files are well suitable for ros-melodic and tbh the prismatic joint was simple as the revolute joint,
atleast in code.
